I created a project that is a replica of the main page of Spotify, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project aims to mimic the layout, design, and some interactive features of Spotifyâ€™s homepage. It involves structuring the content with HTML, styling it with CSS to match the original design, and using JavaScript to add dynamic elements and interactions, such as buttons and hover effects.
